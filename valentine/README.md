Valentine demo (static HTML/CSS/JS)

- Save the image you attached to this chat as `baby-yoda.jpg` in this same folder (`valentine`).
- Open `index.html` in a browser.

Behavior

- The page has a peach background and a centered card.
- Clicking **No** increments the count shown on the **Yes** button (this is intentional).
- The Yes count increases up to 5 by clicking **No**; the next (6th) **No** click changes the screen to a final view.
- Use the Restart button on the final screen to reset (it reloads the page).

Open locally

Double-click `index.html` or open it from your browser via File → Open.

If you want me to recreate a single-file animated GIF from your image and place it into the page, say so and I will generate it and add it into the project.
